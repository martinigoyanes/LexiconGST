# A Toxic Style Transfer Method based on the Delete-Retrieve-Generate framework exploiting Toxic Lexicon Semantic Similarity
Whether consciously or inadvertently, our messages can include toxic language which 1
contributes to the polarization of social networks. Intelligent techniques can help us detect these 2
expressions and even change them into kinder expressions by applying style-transfer techniques. 3
This work aims to advance detoxification style transfer techniques using deep learning and semantic 4
similarity technologies. The article explores the advantages of a toxicity-deletion method that 5
uses linguistic resources in a detoxification system. For this purpose, we propose a method that 6
removes toxic words from the source sentence using a similarity function with a toxic vocabulary. 7
We present two models that leverage it, namely, LexiconGST and MultiLexiconGST, which are based 8
on the Delete&Generate framework. Experimental results show that our models perform well in the 9
detoxification task among state-of-the-art methods. Finally, this research confirms that linguistic 10
resources can guide deep learning techniques and improve its performance.
